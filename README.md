# AWS CloudFormation Deployment and Flyway Configuration for RDS Instance

This documentation provides step-by-step instructions for deploying an RDS (Relational Database Service) instance with SQL Server using AWS CloudFormation and configuring Flyway for database migrations.

## AWS CloudFormation Deployment

### Prerequisites

1. **AWS Account:** Ensure you have an AWS account with the necessary permissions to create resources.
2. **AWS CLI:** Install and configure the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) on your local machine.

### Deployment Steps

#### Step 1: Clone Repository

Clone the CloudFormation script repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

#### Step 2: Configure AWS CLI

Run the following command to configure the AWS CLI with your AWS credentials:

```bash
aws configure
```

Enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region, and preferred output format.

#### Step 3: Modify Parameters

Edit the `template.yml` file to customize parameters such as `dbInstanceID`, `dbUser`, and `dbPassword`.

#### Step 4: Validate CloudFormation Template

Run the following command to validate the CloudFormation template:

```bash
aws cloudformation validate-template --template-body file://template.yml
```

#### Step 5: Create CloudFormation Stack

Run the following command to create the CloudFormation stack:

```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name <stack-name> --template-body file://template.yml --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

Replace `<stack-name>` with your desired stack name.

#### Step 6: Monitor Stack Creation

Monitor the stack creation progress using the AWS CloudFormation console or the following command:

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name <stack-name>
```

#### Step 7: Stack Cleanup (Optional)

If needed, delete the CloudFormation stack to remove the RDS instance:

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name <stack-name>
```

### Notes:

- Ensure that sensitive information, especially database passwords, is handled securely.
- Adjust the security group settings based on your requirements.
- Review the CloudFormation events and logs for detailed information.

## Flyway Installation and Configuration

### Prerequisites

1. **RDS Instance:** Ensure you have an RDS instance with the necessary database created and accessible.
2. **Flyway CLI:** Download and install the Flyway Command-Line Interface (CLI) from the official website: [Flyway Downloads](https://flywaydb.org/download).

3. **Database Migrations:** Prepare SQL migration scripts for your database changes.

### Installation Steps

#### Step 1: Download and Extract Flyway CLI

Download the Flyway CLI archive and extract it to your preferred location on your local machine.

#### Step 2: Configure Flyway

Navigate to the Flyway CLI installation directory and create a `flyway.toml` file within the `conf` directory.

```bash
cd /path/to/flyway
touch conf/flyway.toml
```

Edit the `conf/flyway.toml` file with your RDS instance connection details:

```toml
flyway.url = "jdbc:sqlserver://<rds-instance-endpoint>:<port>;databaseName=<your-database>"
flyway.user = "<your-username>"
flyway.password = "<your-password>"
```

#### Step 3: Set Flyway Environment Variables

Set environment variables for Flyway to point to the configuration file:

```bash
export FLYWAY_CONFIG_FILES=/path/to/flyway/conf/flyway.toml
```

#### Step 4: Run Migrations

Place your SQL migration scripts (`.sql` files) in the `migration` directory within the Flyway installation directory.

Run the following command to perform the database migration:

```bash
./flyway migrate
```

This command will execute all pending migrations and update the database schema.

#### Step 5: Check Migration Status

Verify the migration status using the following command:

```bash
./flyway info
```

This command provides details about applied and pending migrations.

## Additional Flyway Commands

- **Undo Last Migration:**

  ```bash
  ./flyway undo
  ```

- **Clean Database:**

  ```bash
  ./flyway clean
  ```

- **Validate Migrations:**

  ```bash
  ./flyway validate
  ```

### Conclusion

You have successfully installed and configured Flyway to migrate SQL files to your connected RDS instance database using the `flyway.toml` configuration file. Adjust the migration scripts and repeat the migration process as needed for your database changes.
